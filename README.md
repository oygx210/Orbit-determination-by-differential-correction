# Orbit-determination-by-differential-correction

This code made as a part of Internship done under Dr. PD Mishra.
The repository includes the C++ code developed for orbit determination. Also, the preliminary codes for orbit determination using linear least squares are added.

NOTE: The C++ code for orbit determination cannot be excecuted as the data is omitted from the code because of the PRIVACY issues of ISRO. The code can be referred for the procedure followed for orbit determination of the satellites.
